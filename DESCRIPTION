Description: This is a simulator of the contact type model where only the location of cases along with the density of 
              cells or regions are recorde. The key to this is that the inoculum is emitted from a given source and travels along
              a bearing angle. It then deposits at a rondom distance drawn from a prescribed disbtuion. The angle depends on the 
              density of cell or region where the inoculum is deposited. Additionally, new infection occured in a non-homogeneous poisson 
              process with rate proportional to the set of infectious.
